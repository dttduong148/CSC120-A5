- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I think this assignment really helps make the concept of `Association` clearer to me, even though the relationships are not clearly represented in my work.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I got most of the functions to work. I think it is best to look at the demo in class so that you have a grasp of throwing exceptions and the relationships between classes.
